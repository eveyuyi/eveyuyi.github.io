I am currently a Young Researcher at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) specializing in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Transportation Systems. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to ensure the safe, efficient development of smart cities via solving complex mobility challenges.

I received my PhD from Zhejiang University, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Dianhai Wang](http://iits.zju.edu.cn/international/2018/0816/c21523a847061/page.psp), focusing on comprehensive urban traffic state evaluation systems that have been successfully applied in Hangzhou City Brain projects. During my PhD, I worked at Imperial College London as a visiting scholar, collaborating with [Prof. Washington Ochieng](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.ochieng), FREng. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering with a minor in Law from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn).

I have authored 25+ papers at top-tier AI and interdisciplinary venues and journals including ACL, EMNLP, IEEE ITSC, and Transportation Research Part C. My interdisciplinary background allows me to bridge technological innovation with trustworthy frameworks and societal considerations, fostering solutions with real-world impact in urban systems and beyond.
