I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Institution of ITS](http://iits.zju.edu.cn) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) (supervised by [Prof. Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0010034#0)) and joint training PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) (supervised by [Prof. Ochieng](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.ochieng)) , major in transportation engineering. I received my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and a minor in law from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) in 2017. Since 2013, I have studied in and visited several universities, including Zhejiang University, Imperial College London, [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html), [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en), [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca), [Queens Unversity](https://www.queensu.ca), [York University](https://www.york.ac.uk). My research interests are urban network traffic state identification and traffic flow modeling. I have published several articles and participated in a couple of national and municipal research projects related to my research interests. Currently, I serve as reviewer of TRB (Transportation Research Board) Annual Meeting and IEEE ACCESS. 

As a curious and passionate learner, I also cover knowledge of various areas, such as law, computer science, economics, social science, etc. During my spare time, I actively involved in student activities and volunteerings. I hope the world could become slightly better owning to my contribution. I'm also a geek, fascinated productivity tools like Python, SQL, ArcGIS, Notion, Matlab, Photoshop, CAD...
