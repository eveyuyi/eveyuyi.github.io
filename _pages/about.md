I am Yi Yu (Eve), a Young Researcher at [Shanghai AI laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) specializing in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Transportation Systems. My passion lies at leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to solve complex urban mobility challenges and ensure the safe, efficient development of smart cities.

My research focuses on developing next-generation urban systems:
- **Responsible AI** development ensuring trustworthy and equitable smart city solutions
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** for real-world safety applications
- **AI-driven optimization** of intelligent transportation systems
- **Multi-agent systems** and reinforcement learning for traffic control


 I received my PhD from Zhejiang University, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Dianhai Wang](http://iits.zju.edu.cn/international/2018/0816/c21523a847061/page.psp). My doctoral research focused on developing comprehensive urban traffic state evaluation systems, which have been successfully applied in real-world projects. From 2020 to 2022, I was working at Imperial College London as a visiting scholar, where I collaborated closely with [Prof. Washington Ochieng](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.ochieng), FREng. I obtained my bachelor's degree major in Civil Engineering and minor in Law from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) in 2017.  
 
 My interdisciplinary background allows me to approach transportation challenges from multiple perspectives, fostering innovative solutions that consider technological, legal, and societal implications. I have authored over 20 peer-reviewed publications in journals and conferences, as well as actively contributed to national and municipal research projects. Additionally, I am passionate about contributing to the academic community and fostering the next generation of researchers, actively serve as a reviewer for journals and conferences such as IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

As a researcher, I am committed to developing AI technologies that not only advance the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems but also contribute positively to society. I strive to create solutions that enhance urban mobility, promote sustainability, and ensure equitable access to the benefits of smart city innovations. My life motto: "It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness."
